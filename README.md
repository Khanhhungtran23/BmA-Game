# Introduction
This is our Bomberman game project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at HCMIU in semester 2 (2022-2023). We all knew that the game is a classic, but we wanted to make it more interesting and challenging. So we decided to add some new features to the game. We hope you enjoy it!
